# Auto Load
Automatically loads the last loaded game.  Primarily useful to modders.

Hold shift key on game start to not auto load.

Note - The mod will not automatically load until the first load occurs after the mod is installed.

# Settings
|Setting|Default|Description|
|--|--|--|
|LastLoadedSlot|0|The last slot loaded.  Set on first load.  1 is Slot 1, etc.|
|AutoLoadDelayMilliseconds|2000|The number of milliseconds to wait for the shift key to abort the auto load.  Set to zero to immediately load.|

# Changing the Configuration
All options are contained in the config file which is located at ```<Steam Directory>\steamapps\common\Card Survival Tropical Island\BepInEx\config\AutoLoad.cfg```.

The .cfg file will not exist until the mod is installed and then the game is run.

To reset the config, delete the config file.  A new config will be created the next time the game is run.


# Installation 
This section describes how to manually install the mod.

If using the Vortex mod manager from NexusMods, these steps are not needed.  

## Overview
This mod requires the BepInEx mod loader.

## BepInEx Setup
If BepInEx has already been installed, skip this section.

Download BepInEx from https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.21/BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip

* Extract the contents of the BepInEx zip file into the game's directory:
```<Steam Directory>\steamapps\common\Card Survival Tropical Island```

    __Important__:  The .zip file *must* be extracted to the root folder of the game.  If BepInEx was extracted correctly, the following directory will exist: ```<Steam Directory>\steamapps\common\Card Survival Tropical Island\BepInEx```.  This is a common install issue.

* Run the game.  Once the main menu is shown, exit the game.
    
* In the BepInEx folder, there will now be a "plugins" directory.

## Mod Setup
* Download the AutoLoad.zip.  
    * If on Nexumods.com, download from the Files tab.
    * Otherwise, download from https://github.com/NBKRedSpy/CardSurvival-AutoLoad/releases/

* Extract the contents of the zip file into the ```BepInEx/plugins``` folder.

* Run the Game.  The mod will now be enabled.

# Uninstalling

## Uninstall
This resets the game to an unmodded state.
